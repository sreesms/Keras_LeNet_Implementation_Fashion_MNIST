# Keras_LeNet_Implementation_Fashion_MNIST
Implementation of LeNet with Keras on the Fashion_MNIST dataset

Original Paper : LeNet-5 [LeCun et al., 1998. Gradient based learning applied to document recognition] 

The dataset can be found here: https://research.zalando.com/welcome/mission/research-projects/fashion-mnist/

Minor Changes done in the activation function: instead of Sigmoid, here uses the 'Relu' activation.
